I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience in the overall software life-cycle. I have a Ph.D. in computer vision and I'm also specialized in real-time, embedded and safety-critical systems. 

I have professional experience with the technologies listed in the toolbox below.

I create tech content, mostly about algorithms, distributed systems, and programming in general, but I also talk about other topics. 

You can access my content through my [Blog](https://www.francofernando.com) and my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Franc0Fernand0) profile. Looking forward to reaching and helping more people by sharing my knowledge.
